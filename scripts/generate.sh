# The invocation is logic and lives once, in hanzoai/openapi's `generate.py`;
# every per-language knob is data in `sdks.yaml` beside it. This file says "php,
# into this checkout" and nothing else.
#
#   ./scripts/generate.sh              # regenerate src/
#   ./scripts/generate.sh --check      # fail if committed src/ has drifted
#
# BOTH INPUTS ARRIVE AS VALUES. $SPEC is the document, already fetched at a
# pinned ref and digest-checked; $OPENAPI is the checkout holding the driver.
# hanzoai/ci's client lane sets both, because it holds the one credential that
# reads this forge.
#
# uv rather than a bare python3: the driver needs PyYAML and the runner image
# promises no interpreter at all, let alone one with it installed.
#
# Requires: java 17+, uv.
